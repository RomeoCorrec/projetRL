Implementation for Reinforcement Project about Rainbow Paper: (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02298)

It is recommended to load the notebook in Colab for compatibility problems. More over, for reasons we haven't managed to explain, the code doesn't work when we change from gpu to cpu. That's why there are 2 versions of the code, one for cpu and one for gpu.
My recommendation is to set colab execution to T4 gpu and launch the Notebook.
